# ARI (Artificial Residential Intelligence)

## Description
As of 2021, I found the integration of smart home in common smart assistants (such as Google Assistant / Siri / Alexa) pretty poor and I want to change that. ARI is a standalone or plugin Smart Home Assistanpt that works flawlessly with multiple smart home ecosystems and smart assistants. It is self-hosted and can work on any calculator sized computer.
